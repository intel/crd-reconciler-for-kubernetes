# CODEOWNERS syntax is described in the GitHub help docs:
# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners

# These owners are the default owners for everything in
# this repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# these users will be requested for
# review when someone opens a new pull request.
#
# In addition to individual usernames, we can also
# designate teams.
